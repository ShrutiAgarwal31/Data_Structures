Binary Search Tree Concept: 
- Ordered data structure
- BST for child node values greater and less than the parent's values.
  1. Every node contains at most 2 childre, {0, 1, 2} child.
  2. left subtree of the node contains value lesser than the parent's value
  3. right subtree of the node contains value greater than the parent's value
  4. both left and right subtree must be a BST
-BST for duplicate keys__
assumptions made in certain books: 
  1. duplicate values are not allowed in BST.
  2. if duplicate values are present then include it in the left node.
  3. if duplicate values are present then include it in the right node.
  

Operations:
  1. Insertion
  2. Deletion
  3. Traversal
  4. Searching
