Doubly Linked List Data Structure Concept:
  * Each node contains:
    1. data
    2. forward link - link for the next node
    3. backward link - link for the previous node
    
  * Operations
    1. Add
      . Begin
      . End
      . In-Between
    2. Remove
      . Begin
      . End
      . In-Between
    3. Traversal
    
  * Advantages
    1. Easier backward traveral
    
  * Disadvantages:
    1. Extra memory is required for the backward node traversal
